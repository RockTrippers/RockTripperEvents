            <ul> Our logo originated from the idea of combining hard rock and road trippers. The guitar represents hard rock, and instead of strings, it is depicted as a highway, expressing the brand name "rock trippers." </ul>

            <li>Font choices</li>
            <ul>

                The Superclarendon Black italic font is carefully chosen with our target audience in mind. The font has a strong and bold look which fits our brand identity and sets the tone and mood of our website. The font is memorable because of the italics, and it has an old style. </li>
              <ul>
                Oswald Outfit has a stong feel to it, but is not overpowering. The simple pattern resembles the accountability of our company. It is brave, but not too much.

            <ul>

                <li>On the About Page, users can easily plan their event because of the Plan Now button. In this call-to-action part, they can also see the biggest event that there currently is for them next to the planning part.

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Our logo tells the story of our brand's essence, born from the fusion of two vital components: hard rock and road trippers. The term "road trippers" encapsulates the essence of travel, a fundamental part of who we are. At the heart of our logo lies a guitar, symbolizing the raw power and spirit of hard rock music. However, instead of the conventional strings, we've transformed the guitar into a highway, a direct nod to our brand identity, "rock trippers.”</p> 

<p>This deliberate choice embodies the travel experience we provide our customers: a seamless journey along the path of hard rock music, where every twist and turn is an adventure waiting to be discovered. It's about embracing the freedom of the open road, the thrill of exploration, and the camaraderie of fellow enthusiasts.</p> 

<p>By reimagining the guitar as a highway, we've crafted a visual representation of our brand's commitment to offering a carefree travel experience, where the road itself becomes a stage for unforgettable memories and exhilarating encounters.</p> 

<p>As our journey progressed, we uncovered an unexpected rival in Festival Travel. However, we quickly realized that while they focus on large-scale festivals, our niche lies in smaller, more authentic hard rock events. Furthermore, our website's design speaks directly to hard rock fans, with its edgy aesthetic and intuitive interface. It's a platform designed to ignite the passion of music lovers and inspire them to embark on their next adventure with us.</p> 
<p>
Essentially, our logo shows what we're all about and attracts people who love hard rock and traveling. It's a sign of our strong commitment to giving people an amazing travel experience, step by step.</p>
