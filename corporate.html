          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>

          <p>The target group is a male audience, so we focused on both Facebook and Instagram, since we noticed that the target group uses these platforms most. We kept is simple, with not too much distracting features, in order to grab the focus. We used our most important color from the color-pallete, which is very bold and is very noticable.</p> 

          <p>Objective:  
          500 hard rock fans reached through Instagram and Facebook within the first 3 weeks of launching  

          50 packages sold to Roadburn within the first 3 weeks of launching 

          Affect: Connected to the platform, understood and careless 

          Response: interact with the platform about events, chatting to friends about the ease of the brand.</p>  

Media tactics: 

The social media platforms we are going to be campaigning on is Facebook and Instagram since our target group is 25-65 year olds (mainly men). 40-65 year olds do not use social media platforms the least, but they are most active on Facebook. The younger part of our target group uses Instagram the most, so by using these platforms we can reach as many hard rock fans as possible.1 

On Instagram we are going to be posting mainly through Instagram posts and stories. After an event is done we are going to post a reel about it on Instagram. 

On Facebook we are going to be interacting with hard rock fans mainly through groups and by posting on  our page. 

Planning:  

Facebook:  posting on our own account, posting in our group, posting in other groups, commenting on hard rock posts.   

Instagram: Instagram posts, reminders and overviews of when events take place. (planning in canva)</p>
