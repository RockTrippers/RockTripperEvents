            <li>Logo choices</li>
            <ul> Our logo originated from the idea of combining hard rock and road trippers. The guitar represents hard rock, and instead of strings, it is depicted as a highway, expressing the brand name "rock trippers." </ul>

            <li>Font choices</li>
            <ul>

                The Superclarendon Black italic font is carefully chosen with our target audience in mind. The font has a strong and bold look which fits our brand identity and sets the tone and mood of our website. The font is memorable because of the italics, and it has an old style. </li>
              <ul>
                Oswald Outfit has a stong feel to it, but is not overpowering. The simple pattern resembles the accountability of our company. It is brave, but not too much. 

            <li>User interface patterns and the structure of the navigation and content </li>
            <ul>

                <li>On the About Page, users can easily plan their event because of the Plan Now button. In this call-to-action part, they can also see the biggest event that there currently is for them next to the planning part. 
                  Beneath the call-to-action part, users can see our vision and purpose of the site. Underneath this our values can be seen which immediately shows our position and purpose. 
                  
                  When clicking on the Plan Now! Button, users will be redirected to the products our site offers. The products are sorted in cards and users immediately have a clear overview of the products we offer and the choices they can make. A short and clear description is given about the package they can choose. Additionally, users can navigate to the products through the navigation bar.
                  Users can quickly go to our social media pages through the social media buttons at the bottom of the pages.
                  With our strong statements such as: 'festivals like never before' and 'get together, rock it' we give the impression of an unique experience like never before. We offer All-Inclusive trips to the events which is our unique value proposal of our product. 
                   
                 <li>The design of the website is clear and easy to navigate through. Buttons quickly show what can be done on the page and what the purpose is on the page. The main purpose of the website is for users to quickly find information about big events and to plan their trip. 
                  Our tone of voice is direct, casual and enthusiastic and this fits our audience because Hardrock fans coming to our website want to know about events and like that atmosphere. They are the type of person to go to festivals, enjoy their time and wanting to have no worries and convenience. 
                  Our website quickly shows users what they can do and what we offer to them. Users can see that they can plan their event and that we offer them an All-Inclusive experience which is our unique value proposal. </li>

              <ul>
                   
                <li>We want to test the website with our target audience to understand how they navigate through the website. We want to track how easy and convenient it is for them to plan a fully planned event and track how they find information. 
                <li>We aim to test the website with three participants from our target audience. 
                    Testing will be done on a desktop and in the mobile version as well. The testing can be executed in any setting.
                <p>
                </p>
                The instructions that will be given to the participants are: plan an All-Inclusive event, what is the main event of the year, what is the difference between packages, what is the purpose of the website and the service? The testing will be filmed as evidence.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Testing results:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>A positive finding was that the user completed all of the tasks succesfully. They understood the purpose and could find the information quickly.</li>
                <li>A negative finding was that the website was not a fully functional website yet. Accordingly, the price button did not direct to any further page.</li>
                <li><strong>5 E's of usability testing:</strong></li>
                <li>Effective: the user executed all of the tasks succesfully, so that goal has been accomplished.</li>
                <li>Efficient: the user executed the tasks quite easily, however not all of the buttons are fully functional yet.</li>
                <li>Engaging: the user had a clear overview of the packages and the navigation was easy as well</li>
                <li>Error tolerant: the user could navigate back and forth through the navigation bar and this was easy for them.</li>
                <li>Easy to learn: the interface and design was clear for the user. Just as our goal was for the website: ease and convenience</li>
            <li><strong>Improvements</strong></li> for the website will be: fully functional price buttons that will redirect the user to a new page with detailed explanations about the packages. In the new page user can customize their choices and they will be further informed about the price of each element.
                Further improvements would be a fully functional website and design elements such as fonts, colors and structures could be implemented in a more professional way. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>

          <p>Target group:  

            Rocktrippers target group is hard rock fans who are between the age of 25 and 65 years old and mainly men. Niche groups like as described are often very loyal customers when they have found a brand or product which they enjoy, since there are not many other brands or products just like it. We want to make use of this because just like our brand, there are not many competitors who have the same to offer as us.  
            
             The main platforms which this target group uses are Instagram and Facebook. Instagram for following celebrities and musicians, Instagram reels, posting and socializing with friends. Facebook is mainly used for groups, updates, posting and socializing with friends. This target group often gets stereotyped for having long hair and wearing black clothing. They are often seen as more of an aggressive person and introvert, but most of the time they are actually very sensitive and really nice. </p> 

          <p>Objective:  
            Objective:  

            500 hard rock fans reached through Instagram and Facebook within the first 3 weeks of launching  
            
            50 packages sold to Roadburn within the first 3 weeks of launching 


            Media tactics: 

The social media platforms we are going to be campaigning on is Facebook and Instagram since our target group is 25-65 year olds (mainly men). 40-65 year olds are not as active on social media platforms like the younger generation of 25-40, but they are most active on Facebook. The younger part of our target group uses Instagram the most, so by using these platforms we can reach as many hard rock fans as possible.1 

Instagram will be used to post Instagram posts and stories to share content which engages with the audience about hard rock music, upcoming events and behind-the-scenes. Instagram will also be used to post reels to show highlights from events. This gives the followers an insight on what the experience is like with Rocktrippers.  We also want to collab with influencers and artists who are popular amongst our users to increase a bigger audience and to create credibility. Something we want to focus on on Instagram is the usage of hashtags. Through hashtags we want to increase our presence by making it easier for users to find us.  

Facebook will be used to engage with hard rock fans through facebook groups where members discuss their favorite bands, experiences, concerts and other hard rock related topics. This increases the community feeling, since it is a low-key way of interacting with other hard rock fans. We will also post updates and announcements on our own page. This includes event details, special offers, hard rock music, upcoming events and behind-the-scenes. We want to be very engaging on Facebook, so we will be commenting and engaging in groups and posts of hard rock communities or fans. 

To have a feeling of continuity most of the content which is posted on Instagram will also be posted on Facebook.

               Planning:  

Facebook:  posting on our own account, posting in our group, posting in other groups, commenting on hard rock posts.   

Instagram: Instagram posts, reminders and overviews of when events take place. (planning in canva)

              On the website page, the context of the campaign is explained in excellent detail. (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). The objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan are also present and described in excellent detail, in SMART method. 

The campaign is about introducing the users to Rocktrippers. We are showing what great things we can do for them: helping them get to events, giving them the possibility to connect with fellow hard rock lovers and helping them with finding a place for them to stay. In the campaign we post the events which they can go to through our brand, recaps of those events and overviews of coming events. Our message through this campaign is to make hard rock fans feel as a community by being able to go to these events with a group. The promotional campaign was done through Instagram and Facebook by posting our content. Our objectives were to sell 50 packages to Roadburn and to reach 500 hard rock fans within the first 3 weeks of launching. These were not reached. We reached around a 100 people through Instagram and Facebook. 

 

The chosen channels/platforms used are explained in great detail and justified and there is an excellent connection to the objectives established in the Communication & Media Plan. 

 

We have strategically chosen Facebook and Instagram for our platforms based on the demographics of our target audience, which consists of 25- to 65-year-olds and mainly men. Our decision is based on the fact that while the 40- to 65-year-old segment does use social media less frequently, they are most active on Facebook. however, the younger portion of our target group, aged 25 to 40, mostly use Instagram. By using these platforms, we want to maximize our reach to hard rock fans across the whole age group. 

On Instagram, our strategy includes posting regularly through both standard posts and stories to maintain engagement. Additionally, we plan to create and share reels that provide recaps of events, enhancing our content's appeal and reach.  

On Facebook, our strategy includes engaging with hard rock fans mostly through groups and regular posts on our page. By doing this we want to create a sense of community and encourage people to participate in conversations. 

On the website page, the learning points are identified and justified (based on the Communication & Media Plan) in excellent detail that showcase a thorough reflection of the entire journey. Elements such as:What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign? What worked and what didn’t? What went as expected and what didn’t? What would you do differently?The reflection on the past work has been thoroughly explored and described in great detail, leaving no questions.  

During the project, we gained several insights about our campaign. Firstly, we learned that it is very important to engage early on so that we build a following during the campaign. Our delayed start put us at a disadvantage, and this was a very important learning point. 

What worked well was keeping everything organised through planning well. This helped to keep our content consistent. However, we realised that our strategy on Facebook did not have the expected results. Specifically, we found that people were not to joining the groups we created. This was supposed to be our primary interaction platform with hard rock fans, so  with this not working out the way we wanted was a setback for us.  

Reflecting on these experiences, we  would do multiple things different for our future campaigns. We would start our engagement efforts much earlier, focusing on building a following before the launch. Additionally, we would use  more interaction platforms or methods, since the engagement was low on Facebook groups. 

Reflection on what has been done and detailed description what the student would do if the project would continue is of excellent quality. Examples are giving in terms of new, additional content.  

We would recommend posting 2 Instagram posts a week and 2 Instagram stories a week. We would also add going live once every two weeks so users can interact in an lowkey way. Another thing we would add is to make a group of everyone who has used Rocktrippers so we would also build a community. For Facebook we would continue with our group by posting information posts and polls. We would also interact more with the group we created and would prioritize increasing the amount of people who are in the group. We would continue commenting and interacting with posts of hard rock groups and fans so that we bring attention to our page. 

Very detailed description of future recommendations if the campaign would be continued are provided, based on insights and/or literature. 

Based on our experience with this project, there are several aspects we would approach differently because of  the insights we got along the way. We should have had  a more structured  plan from the beginning.  Setting clear objectives and timelines would have provided use with a great base to increase the campaigns effectiveness. This would have helped so we could have put numbers we wanted to reach weekly, which would have increased the interactions we have. The interactions is the other main thing we would approach differently looking back. We did not focus making the interactions interactive enough. This would be improved by going live, posting polls and interacting with other posts. 

Detailed and clear description on the process of what the student would do differently based on his/her experience on this project related to the marketing assignment are explored in-depth, showcasing the learning points in excellent detail. New information is derived from this and showcased.  

At the start of the project, we did not have a clear  plan before the campaign began. Having a detailed plan from the start would have given us a better start since everything would have been more clear, which leads to the campaign being more effective. This would have given us an opportunity to set weekly targets, likely focussing more on our interactions and engagement. 

During the campaign, we eventually implemented a more structured plan, and this proved to work way better. Therefore, one of our most important learning points is the importance of thorough pre-campaign planning. In future projects, we would start with a well thought out marketing strategy with specific goals and timelines so we do not have to focus on this during the campaign. This approach create  a more organized and impactful campaign, which gives jus  better results and more engagement.

           <p> NEW REDO CANVAS
<br>

            In the first lean canvas, you can see our initial idea, which was to create a website for the community of hard rock fans. However, after receiving feedback from teachers and reflecting on the interviews, we realized that this idea didn't really fit the target audience. Hard rock fans are often between the ages of 25 and 65, including older individuals who may not be as active online. Therefore, an online platform for the hard rock community wasn't a good idea. 

            So, based on our interviews, we continued brainstorming. After talking to more people, it became clear that this target audience has more disposable income but doesn't want to spend time organizing trips and traveling back and forth. This led us to the idea of creating a travel agency for the hard rock community, offering a carefree experience. We received positive feedback on this idea, including from hard rock fans themselves. This resulted in the second lean canvas.
